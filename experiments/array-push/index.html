    <h1>Array <code>push()</code> vs. Fixed Array Experiment</h1>
    <code>July 21, 2019</code>
    <p>
      What is the performance between the two? Let's answer that question.
    </p>
    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <p>
      For this experiment, we want to find out whether, or not there is a
      significant performance difference between
      <em>appending</em> an element to an array using
      <code>Array.prototype.push</code>, or using a array indexing to assign the
      element to a fixed-sized array.
    </p>
    <p>
      For both experiments, <code>MAX_SIZE = 100000</code> array elements will
      be appended to the array. A total of <code>TOTAL_RUNS = 1000</code> will
      be performed to append <code>MAX_SIZE</code> elements to the array.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to keep the memory footprint low, and only interest is to measure
      the time it takes to add elements, the <code>push</code> experiment will
      <strong>reassign</strong> an empty array after every run. For the
      fixed-array experiment, the <code>currIndex</code> will be reassigned to
      <strong>0</strong>.
    </p>

      This was tested with Google Chrome 75. So the V8 engine was used.

      As it turns out, in the average case, <code>Array.prototype.push</code> is
      almost <strong>3.2x</strong> <em>slower</em>
      than using a fixed-sized array with indexing. Why is that?
    </p>
    <p>
      What seems to be the case is that if an arrays are treated more like
      lists, such as the Java <code>ArrayList</code>, for example. This means
      that an array without a fixed known size that is initially allocated like
      the following:
    </p>
    <pre>
        var arr = [];
    </pre>
    <p>
      Has a fixed-block of memory allocated for it to some size. When
      <code>push</code> is called, the array will be resized if there is not
      enough space within this block of memory to store the new element.
      Therefore a resizing routine is executed to create a bigger array, and
      then copy the existing elements to this new array before finally appending
      the new element to the new array. Of course, the existing array reference
      is then updated to reference this new array.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now for arrays in which we already know the number of elements we need to
      add to, it is best to just have a setup routine that can allocate the
      total number of elements first, and keeping track of the current index
      when appending to the array. This way, we can avoid the resizing routine
      performed, and will save a lot of execution time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fixed arrays won't work if your arrays become too large though, so it
      really depends on your use-case here on which method to actually use.
