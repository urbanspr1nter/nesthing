#Introduction

In my opinion, writing an emulator is one of the most difficult projects a software developer can undertake.

There are other certain things that make writing emulators hard:

* Learning the system architecture of the platform to be emulated.
* Reverse engineering the behavior of each component through inspecting how code is executed, or reading tons of documentation available for the platform.
* Convincing oneself to think at the cycle-for-cyle level when it comes to executing code and writing to memory. Most software developers can get away without thinking this low-level.

All in all, expect a lot of difficult challenges along the way when getting started in writing an emulator.

Usually, the best advice given when Google searching: "How to write an emulator" is to start writing an emulator for some 8-bit microcomputer.

The Nintendo Entertainment System (yes, I'm American) is the system I have chosen for myself to try and emulate.
