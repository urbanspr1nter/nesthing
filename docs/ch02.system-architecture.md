# NES Technical Review (DRAFT)

Of course, being an extremely popular game console, the NES is extremely well documented. A lot of the information is accessible through online articles and lots of discussion regarding the technical intricacies are discussed and documented in online forums.

The website that is most referenced for all-things-NES is [NesDev](https://nesdev.com). The [wiki](http://wiki.nesdev.com) and [forums](http://forums.nesdev.com) contain endless amounts of NES system information and how to program for it.

Regardless, I feel like it is only respectful to *at least* give a high-level overview and discussion on the basic history and hardware of the NES.

## History

The NES was released as the Nintendo Famicom in July, 1983 in Japan. It made its way to North America in October, 1985. A full two years after the initial Japanese launch, the North American launch was met with much excitement.

At the time of its North American launch, the region had just experienced a [catastrophic video game crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_crash_of_1983). Consumers at the time were very hesistant to purchase another video games system. However, due to the high-quality titles available in the NES, the system avoided the same mistakes its contemporaries made: releasing quantity over quality when it came to video game titles. 

With higher quality titles being sold, and solid marketing campaigns, the NES was not only credited for reviving the video game industry in the US in the 1980s, but it also pioneered a lot of other now standard practices with regards to developing and publishing video games.

Prior to the video game crash in North America in 1983, it was extremely easy to publish video games for existing systems such as the Atari VCS. Anything could be produced, and sold. These systems would then have a large library of video games, but as a consequence would have many low-quality titles.

### Conception

[TODO] How did the NES came to be? What were the ideas?

### Technical Choices

At the time of design, most video game consoles being sold such as the Atari VCS, ColecoVision, InvelliVision and a few others were based off of 8-bit CPUs. The most popular CPU architecture being used at the time was the 6502 architecture designed by MOS technologies, which both the Atari and Nintendo used.

Originally, Nintendo wanted to go with a 16-bit CPU for the Famicom, but the company wanted to keep manufacturing costs down. As a result, the choice was to go with a variant of the MOS 6502 -- the 2A03 produced by Ricoh Technologies (2A07 for PAL). Along with the 2A03, Nintendo paired the CPU with a custom picture processing unit (PPU) dedicated handling all graphics work. 

The 2A03 was simply a cut-down MOS 6502. This made costs even cheaper and removed unnecessary components within the chip that Nintendo did not need for the Famicom to execute its instructions. Computationally, the Famicom was not much faster than the other 8-bit video game consoles in the market at the time. It was the audio and video capabilities of the Famicom that separated the system from the competition.

### Practices

One of the unique practices which Nintendo introduced as a "Seal of Quality". This brought the process of not allowing video game titles to be sold on the system unless prior authorization and terms with regards to distribution were in agreement with Nintendo.

In order to comply with the practice of obtaining rights to publish titles on the system, third party developers went through rigorous quality checks and testing with their games. Their titles had 

### Marketing

Nintendo had not chose to market the Famicom in its original name for North America. Mostly due to avoiding any association and stigma with immediately being thought of as a "video game console" or a toy that could not be taken seriously, Nintendo of North America wanted to evoke an image of the console as more of an "entertainment system". 

In early marketing and press material in the United States, the NES was marketed as a home computer, dubbed "AVS". It was completely redesigned from the Famicom's childish design of red and white plastic. What was replaced this scheme were shades of greys with intention of giving an interpretation of what the 1980s considered to be the "future. Eventually, this design was soon scrapped in favor of a simpler design -- the design which we all come to remember as the "toaster". 

Why Nintendo had redesigned the NES in the first place was due to the fact that North America did not have a thriving video game market after the crash. In fact, many retailers were hesistant to actually sell the system due to the video game crash which had occurred a couple years earlier.

Nintendo was initially strategic in its NES launch. Nintendo had performed a series of "test runs" in specific markets to gauge the interest of the NES by the American public. 

Initial test runs were promising and by 1986, Nintendo had sold 1.1 million consoles. 

In 1993, Nintendo released a redesigned model of the NES. The model was NES-101 and looked similar to the SNES. This was discontinued in 2003 world wide, but in 1995 for the United States.
