# NES Technical Review (DRAFT)

Of course, being an extremely popular game console, the NES is extremely well documented. A lot of the information is accessible through online articles and lots of discussion regarding the technical intricacies are discussed and documented in online forums.

The website that is most referenced for all-things-NES is [NesDev](https://nesdev.com). The [wiki](http://wiki.nesdev.com) and [forums](http://forums.nesdev.com) contain endless amounts of NES system information and how to program for it.

Regardless, I feel like it is only respectful to *at least* give a high-level overview and discussion on the basic history and hardware of the NES.

## History

The NES was released as the Nintendo Famicom in July, 1983 in Japan. It made its way to North America in October, 1985. A full two years after the initial Japanese launch, the North American launch was met with much hype.

The console was not only credited for reviving the video game industry in the US in the 1980s, but it also pioneered a lot of other now standard practices with regards to developing and publishing video games.

Prior to the video game crash in North America in 1983, it was extremely easy to publish video games for existing systems such as the Atari 2600. Anything could be produced, and sold. These systems would then have a large library of video games, but as a consequence would have many low-quality titles.

One of the unique practices which Nintendo introduced as a "Seal of Quality". This brought the process of not allowing video game titles to be sold on the system unless prior authorization and terms with regards to distribution were in agreement with Nintendo.

The choice to go with a variant of the 8-bit MOS 6502 was purely cost. Nintendo had considered to use a 16-bit CPU, but wanted to keep costs down by using an 8-bit CPU paired with a dedicated custom graphics chip (PPU).

Originally, in United States, the NES was marketed as a home computer, dubbed "AVS". It was completely redesigned from the Famicom's childish design of red and white plastic. What was replaced was a grey colors scheme with the 1980s interpretation of "the future". This design was soon scrapped in favor of a simpler design --- the design which we all come to remember as the "toaster". 

Why Nintendo had redesigned the NES in the first place was due to the fact that North America did not have a thriving video game market after the crash. In fact, many retailers were hesistant to actually sell the system due to the video game crash which had occurred a couple years earlier.

Nintendo was initially strategic in its NES launch. Nintendo had performed a series of "test runs" in specific markets to gauge the interest of the NES by the American public. 

Initial test runs were promising and by 1986, Nintendo had sold 1.1 million consoles. 

In 1993, Nintendo released a redesigned model of the NES. The model was NES-101 and looked similar to the SNES. This was discontinued in 2003 world wide, but in 1995 for the United States.
